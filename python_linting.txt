 ***What is Linting? ***
 ------------------------
Linting is the process of analyzing source code to detect:

.Errors

.Potential bugs

.Style violations

.Security vulnerabilities

.Code smells (bad practices that donâ€™t cause bugs but reduce code quality)

It's often used in languages like Python, JavaScript, C/C++, Java, etc.

 *** Why is Linting Important? ***
 ---------------------------------
1.Code Consistency: Enforces consistent style across your codebase.

2.Catches Errors Early: Helps detect bugs before running the code.

3.Improves Readability: Clean and standardized code is easier to read.

4.Saves Time: Reduces debugging and code review time.

5.Supports Best Practices: Encourages better programming habits.
